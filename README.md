# test_case_enterideas

This repository contains a test case project on Neural Network classification of Saint George's images.
The project was created in Google Colab python notebook. I will recommend to run this .ipynb file using Google Colab too.
Three NN architectures were tested: 1) ResNet50, 2) LeNet, 3) AlexNet.
The best result was obtained with AlexNet NN.
